# Lo-Encontre
A one-stop site to look up deals. 


A website that uses web scraping, a form of machine learning, to help users find products with good deals and notify them of upcoming sales. Users can also sell items on the website. The website's front end is built with React, while NodeJS is used as the backend development tool and MongoDB as the database. We plan to deploy the website on Heroku and test it using Selenium.
